Lime Point of Sales
===================

Introduction
------------

A point of sale is the place where a transaction takes place during the exchange of goods and services.  In the past this was generally the physical checkout counter of a store, but as the world transitions to an internet-based economy the point of sale has shifted from a physical, hardware location to an online location.  In order to facilitate these transactions, Null Pointer Productions will provide an online, cloud-based point of sale service to online and bricks and mortar merchants.  Our service will allow merchants to keep track of their inventory, process transactions and have access to their critical information from anywhere that has an internet connection.

Our service will be superior to localized solutions such as Lemon POS because everything will be hosted and stored online, protecting vital information from local system crashes.  It will also provide a cleaner interface and more efficient backend using powerful web technologies.
